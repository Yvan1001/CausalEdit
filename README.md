We propose a flow trajectory sampling strategy that constructs proxy inputs by interpolating latents along the linear transport path between the source latent and a synthetic target latent. 
Then, an interventional velocity fusion mechanism is designed to aggregate predicted velocities conditioned on the sampled latents, thereby producing less biased outputs than previous methods.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that <strong>CausalEdit</strong>  significantly improves editing controllability and fidelity, highlighting the effectiveness of causal modeling for the visual editing task.
